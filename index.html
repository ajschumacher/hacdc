                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p>In 1998, E.O. Wilson wrote a book “Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge”, which highlighted the history of information theory and learning, while also outlining the inherent overlap of traditional academic disciplines. (Think ‘Humanities’, ‘Math and Sciences’, ‘The Arts’.) The Consilience Center encourages people to think about education --- information, skills, and experiences -- through this holistic, participatory light, with technology as a core unifying force.</p>

                        <p>Technology is a mechanism to identify intersections among bodies of knowledge. We constantly interact with code and the subsequent virtual realms of reality it produces; networks, relationships and connectivity surface in areas that were previously unknown. But ultimately, these new realities are a reflection of us - our values, our relationships, our systems of understanding.</p>

                        <p>Working with a group of passionate people towards shared objectives is an equally important component in contextualizing and retaining information, as well as building skills and understanding. Although there are a lot of existing resources available online, there are few opportunities to learn technical skills as a community, at a reasonable cost. We strive to create a collaborative and inclusive learning environment that allows people to gain technical skills for a variety of reasons --- creative expression, social application, intrinsic curiosity  --- in a truly holistic and ‘consilient’ manner. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                         In the spirit of all things open and participatory, we are strongly in favor of open source platforms, structures and practices, and we incorporate these values and best practices in our curriculum accordingly.

                            There are many organizations that are moving away from institutional credentialing, towards more collaborative and diverse learning environments. Below are a few that inspire the direction of this initiative.
